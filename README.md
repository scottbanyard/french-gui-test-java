# French Test using a GUI in Java (swing)

I began this GUI by following on from my frenchTranslations.c program (found in https://github.com/scottbanyard/french-programs-C).
I wanted to be able to represent a test system with a GUI, so I decided to recap swing in Java.

Simple UI shown below :

### Current Progress:

`- full test questions in place for months and colours`

`- only asks questions on certain numbers`

`- score system - tells you how many you got right at the end`

`- asks 5 questions randomly using Random`

`- quit button`

### Improvements:

`- improve design - make it look more colourful`

`- work out a system to ask questions on all numbers (index possibly)`

`- choose how many questions you want`

`- feedback on questions you got wrong (show right answer)`
